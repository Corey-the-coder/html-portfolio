<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Current Top 3 (in no particular order)</h2><hr />
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Is this really one of my top three movies or does my nostalgia<br />
 refuse to let it go?  It did have a massive impact in film,
 storytelling<br /> and an affinity for screen violence.
<h3>Two Days One Night</h3>
<p>The protagonist's battle with depression is inspiring.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>An animated movie had to be in there, and even more fitting to choose <br />
 an anime. Spirited Away is an amazing anime movie. Though I could <br />
go a completely different direction, like Perfect Blue.</p>
